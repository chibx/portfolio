      <h2 class="text-2xl bebas-neue mb-2.5">HEYðŸ‘‹ GLAD YOU MADE IT HERE</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Chiebidolu Chinaemerem, and I am a fullstack web developer who is very passionate about web
        development and technology. I love to build scalable and functional fullstack web applications, with my goto
        programming
        language being <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born on July 15, 2006, I am a full & proud citizen of my motherland, Nigeria. I am currently studying
        <strong>Data Science</strong> at
        <strong>University of Lagos</strong>, Nigeria, before which I studied in <strong>Jextoban Secondary
          School</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always had a liking for technology and programming, and I became interested in fullstack development
        (mainly website, mobile application, and software development) after my secondary education.
        I began learning programming as a self-taught developer in 2022, watched a lot of tutorials on YouTube and
        learned a lot of things, and I am always working on myself to become a better developer.

        My true strength lies in programming languages/frameworks defined in the <strong>"Core"</strong> section above, but that doesn't mean
        I can't work with languages/frameworks defined in the secondary section as well.

      <h2 class="text-2xl bebas-neue mt-10 mb-2.5">THINGS I DO IN MY FREE TIME</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Programming (Can't escape this one)</li>
        <li>Listening to songs (It goes well with Programming)</li>
        <li>Watching Anime ðŸ˜Ž (You've gotta try this one)</li>
        <li>Playing video games (Once in a while)</li>
        <li>Reading books (Mostly programming documentation)</li>
        <li>Forcing myself to take a break from programming</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-10">
        As much as I love anime, programming seems to draw me in, hence I spend most of my time programming. <br />
        Regardless of it being my time to relax, I still hear the voice of my laptop telling me to come back and write
        code ðŸ˜…<br />
        Also, just because I love anime a lot doesn't make me a weeb or weird, people like me have what they love and I
        believe they shouldn't be criticized for something like this <em>(just saying)</em>
